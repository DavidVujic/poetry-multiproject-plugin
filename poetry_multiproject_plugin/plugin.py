class MultiProjectPlugin(ApplicationPlugin):
    """
    A Poetry plugin, adding commands that supports including packages outside of the project root.
    This is achieved by setting the workspace (or commonly the repo) folder as the root folder,
    and being able to specify a project specific TOML file.

    Add an empty `workspace.toml` file at the workspace root. The plugin will look for it
    to determine where the workspace is. The TOML file is available to use for other plugins.

    Usage:
    running the command from the workspace root folder
    `poetry build-project -t path/to/myproject.toml`

    Optionally, run the command from the same folder as the actual project specific TOML file:
    `poetry build-project`
